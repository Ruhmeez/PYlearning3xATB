# Task #2

#Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8

#Program:
num = 2
square_num = print(num**2)
cube_num = print(num**3)


#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

#Program:

x = input("Enter first number:\n")
y = input("Enter second number:\n")

print("x is greater than y" if x>y else "y is greater than x")
print("x is equal to y" if x==y else "x is not equal to y")
